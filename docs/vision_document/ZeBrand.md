## Por que?

### REASON

> #### What was the main motivation for starting your business?

> Reflect on what you were thinking and feeling when you first came up with the idea for your business. What sparked it? How did you know it was something the world needs?

> For example
>
> - I realised that many people were tracking their physical health but not their mental health. I wanted to give people more awareness and control over their emotions too.

##### motivações iniciais

- Disciplina e fazer alguma coisa relacionada à ONU
- Íamos fazer um mapa da Dengue, planta que mata dengue
- Já perdi algumas plantas, queria saber cultivar
- gaia-dex

##### motivações atuais

- Fornecer um espaço aberto para se desenvolver uma comunidade
- Auxiliar numa reconecção entre as pessoas do meio urbano cinzento com a flora
- Fornecer interesse e facilidade no acesso à informação

### OFFER

> #### How would you describe your product or service in a sentence or two?

> Focus on the customer benefits first, then what your company provides to support that. Keep it short—this isn’t about listing features, it’s about identifying your main offering that improves your customer’s life.

> "We've created wearable technology that helps track your mood and allows you to examine the data when you get home."

- Geramos uma plataforma que facilita o contato entre as pessoas que se interessam pela cultura de jardinagem
- Uma plataforma que proporciona a disseminação de conhecimento e debate sobre a flora, no modo geral

### EDGE

> #### In what way are you offering something new or better than what already exists?

> Think about all the other ways your customer is already fulfilling their needs. What makes you a better choice? What makes your offering unique? For example, are you faster or more efficient? Do you offer a better value?

> There are a lot of meditation apps on the market and also a lot of apps that connect you to a virtual doctor. But there's nothing that helps you make everyday changes to your life to boost your overall positivity.

- Nós providenciamos um espaço centralizado onde voce pode ter acesso a:
  1 - identificação de planta
  2 - informações sobre a planta
  3 - interação com suas plantas cadastradas

Mas, principalmente, o fator de fornecer um suporte da comunidade.

## Quem?

### Demografia do publico-alvo

> #### Identify your target demographic.

> Your audience might be diverse, but who comes to mind when you think about the ideal customer? Who would your product be perfect for?

- qualquer classe social

### Consumidor

> #### How would you describe your target market?

> Think about their needs, lifestyle, desires and concerns. Consider them from a psychological perspective, not just demographic. What things do they care about? What do they value and why?

Qualquer pessoa que se interesse por botânica.

### COMPETIDORES

> #### What other products or services might your target market use to meet their needs?

## Como?

### RESOURCES

> #### What tools, resources, or capabilities will you need to make your product or service a reality?
